# b3dsdf ðŸ§°

b3dsdf (blender signed distance functions) is a collection of 2D signed distance functions and operators nodegroups for the shader editor in Blender 2.83+.

These nodes can be used by appending from the .blend file or use them with the addon which adds a menu in the shader editor.

They can also be used with the asset browser by adding the .blend as an asset library and marking them as assets.
