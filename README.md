# b3dsdf

b3dsdf is a collection of 2d signed distance functions and operators nodegroups for Blender 2.83 or above. Also available as an addon which adds a menu in the shader editor.

All nodegroups were already marked as assets so this can also be added as an asset library which can be used with the asset browser in 3.0.

## Available Nodegroups

A list of available nodegroups can be viewed in the [shader_nodes.json](https://github.com/williamchange/b3dsdf/blob/master/shader_nodes.json) file. There's currently 40 nodegroups.
